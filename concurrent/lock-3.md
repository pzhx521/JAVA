The synchronize keyword **can lock any non-null object.** It belongs to **the exclusive pessimistic lock and the re-entrainable lock.** </br>

Scope of synchronized Keyword:</br>
1.When it acts as a **common method,the current object instance (this) is locked.** </br>
2.When it acts as a **static method,the class instance is locked.** </br>
3.When it acts on a **non-null object,it latches all blocks of code that are locked on that object.** </br>
eg:
```java
public class Test{

	//1
	public synchronized void test1(){
		//do something
	}

	//2
	public static synchronized void test2(){
		//do something
	}
